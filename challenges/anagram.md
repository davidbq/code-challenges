# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge: Anagram Checker

## Problem Statement

Write a function that takes two words (Strings) and returns `True` if they are anagrams of each other, otherwise returns `False`.

- An **anagram** is a word that can be formed by rearranging all the letters of another word.
- Two words that are exactly the same are not considered anagrams.

### Example Output

For the words "listen" and "silent":

    True

For the words "hello" and "world":

    False
